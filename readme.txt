Git Basics

I'm learning the basics of Git and Github, so this repo is really just for experimenting. local change for test

test local master with changes to both remote and a local branch.

9/15 remote master change. test bringing master changes from remote to local master, then to branch. 

created a branch, play-branch, to see what happens
play-branch change to test pull down changes.  Also changed remote master and local master.

change to make sure git pull <branchname> doesn't also pull master changes

9/16 Remote Master: test "git pull origin" effect on local branch that has changed
